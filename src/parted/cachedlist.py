    """CachedList()

       Provides an immutable list that is constructed from a function that
       could take a while to run.  This is basically the same concept as
       memoization, except that the function does not take any parameters
       and therefore there is nothing to use as a memo.

       The constructor function is provided to __init__, must not take any
       parameters, and must return a list.  The invalidate() method indicates
       that the list is no longer valid and should be reconstucted by
       calling the function again.  It is up to client code to call invalidate.
       The rest of the procedure is handled by this class.

       In all ways, this should appear to be just like a list."""
